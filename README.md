# SQL Genius üöÄ

A powerful SQL query agent application that leverages OpenAI's language model to interpret and execute SQL queries on user-uploaded databases. Built with Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for natural language to SQL query conversion and execution.

**Live Demo**: [SQL Genius](https://sqlgenius20250212.streamlit.app/)

> **Note**: This project builds upon and references the excellent work from [@yefan/tiny-sql-agent](https://github.com/yefan/tiny-sql-agent). We extend their core concepts with additional features and improvements.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select Database**
   - Choose from pre-loaded sample databases, or
   - Upload your own `.db` file

2. **Ask Your Question**
   - Type natural language questions like:
     ```
     Which UK customers have spent more than $1000?
     Show me the top 10 products by sales volume
     ```
   - Or write SQL queries directly

3. **Execute & View Results**
   - Click "Execute SQL Query"
   - View results in the interactive table
   - Download results as CSV if needed

### Example Queries

**Natural Language:**
```
"Find all employees who joined after 2010 and earn more than $50,000"
```

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date > '2010-01-01' AND salary > 50000
```
